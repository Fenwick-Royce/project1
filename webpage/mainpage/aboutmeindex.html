            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in bakersfield, but most of my childhood<br>
                was in special education. I was dignosed with Autism at a very yong age.
                </br><br>Most of my social life was a struggle until I hit highschool and became
                </br><br>more extroverted. Learning how to open up to people without fearing being underhanded
                </br><br>Thanks to tranisitoning from intorvert to extrovert, I developed a better social</br><br>
                now a days I spend my waking ours visiting the library and local friendly game stores for social time.
                and of course</br>
                <br>I volunteer at MARE. I like working with horses</br>
