            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I have been more or less of a life long learner. in fact... <br>
                you might as well say its my life goal. I have been a Graduate of
                </br><br>Independence Highschool. Class of 2012. and attended Taft College</br><br>
                and Long Beach Job Corps and Long Beach City college. I surprisingly became a
                model student in Long Beach Job Corps.
                </br><br>Not that i should say that I am an exemplar to construction. but I was quite
                well respected when it comes to recreation and social life there. Heck, I even earned
                </br><br>Center Presidency from my contribution to volutneering</br></p>
